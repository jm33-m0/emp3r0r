Python module and command-line tool for storing and retrieving data in a
Docker registry.

-  Store arbitrary data (blob-store)
-  Content addressable
-  Set up named aliases to blobs
-  Supports Docker registry schema v1 and v2
-  Works on Python 2.7 and 3.4

Command-line example:

.. code:: shell

    dxf push-blob fred/datalogger logger.dat @may15-readings
    dxf pull-blob fred/datalogger @may15-readings

which is the same as:

.. code:: shell

    dxf set-alias fred/datalogger may15-readings $(dxf push-blob fred/datalogger logger.dat)
    dxf pull-blob fred/datalogger $(dxf get-alias fred/datalogger may15-readings)

Module example:

.. code:: python

    from dxf import DXF

    def auth(dxf, response):
        dxf.authenticate('fred', 'somepassword', response=response)

    dxf = DXF('registry-1.docker.io', 'fred/datalogger', auth)

    dgst = dxf.push_blob('logger.dat')
    dxf.set_alias('may15-readings', dgst)

    assert dxf.get_alias('may15-readings') == [dgst]

    for chunk in dxf.pull_blob(dgst):
        sys.stdout.write(chunk)

Usage
-----

The module API is described
`here <http://rawgit.davedoesdev.com/davedoesdev/dxf/master/docs/_build/html/index.html>`__.

The ``dxf`` command-line tool uses the following environment variables:

-  ``DXF_HOST`` - Host where Docker registry is running.
-  ``DXF_INSECURE`` - Set this to ``1`` if you want to connect to the
   registry using ``http`` rather than ``https`` (which is the default).
-  ``DXF_USERNAME`` - Name of user to authenticate as.
-  ``DXF_PASSWORD`` - User's password.
-  ``DXF_AUTHORIZATION`` - HTTP ``Authorization`` header value.
-  ``DXF_AUTH_HOST`` - If set, always perform token authentication to
   this host, overriding the value returned by the registry.
-  ``DXF_PROGRESS`` - If this is set to ``1``, a progress bar is
   displayed (on standard error) during ``push-blob`` and ``pull-blob``.
   If this is set to ``0``, a progress bar is not displayed. If this is
   set to any other value, a progress bar is only displayed if standard
   error is a terminal.
-  ``DXF_BLOB_INFO`` - Set this to ``1`` if you want ``pull-blob`` to
   prepend each blob with its digest and size (printed in plain text,
   separated by a space and followed by a newline).
-  ``DXF_CHUNK_SIZE`` - Number of bytes ``pull-blob`` should download at
   a time. Defaults to 8192.

You can use the following options with ``dxf``. Supply the name of the
repository you wish to work with in each case as the second argument.

-  ``dxf push-blob <repo> <file> [@alias]``

       Upload a file to the registry and optionally give it a name
       (alias). The blob's hash is printed to standard output.

       The hash or the alias can be used to fetch the blob later using
       ``pull-blob``.

-  ``dxf pull-blob <repo> <hash>|<@alias>...``

       Download blobs from the registry to standard output. For each
       blob you can specify its hash (remember the registry is
       content-addressable) or an alias you've given it (using
       ``push-blob`` or ``set-alias``).

-  ``dxf blob-size <repo> <hash>|<@alias>...``

       Print the size of blobs in the registry. If you specify an alias,
       the sum of all the blobs it points to will be printed.

-  ``dxf del-blob <repo> <hash>|<@alias>...``

       Delete blobs from the registry. If you specify an alias the blobs
       it points to will be deleted, not the alias itself. Use
       ``del-alias`` for that.

-  ``dxf set-alias <repo> <alias> <hash>|<file>...``

       Give a name (alias) to a set of blobs. For each blob you can
       either specify its hash (as printed by ``get-blob``) or, if you
       have the blob's contents on disk, its filename (including a path
       separator to distinguish it from a hash).

-  ``dxf get-alias <repo> <alias>...``

       For each alias you specify, print the hashes of all the blobs it
       points to.

-  ``dxf del-alias <repo> <alias>...``

       Delete each specified alias. The blobs they point to won't be
       deleted (use ``del-blob`` for that), but their hashes will be
       printed.

-  ``dxf list-aliases <repo>``

       Print all the aliases defined in the repository.

-  ``dxf list-repos``

       Print the names of all the repositories in the registry. Not all
       versions of the registry support this.

Certificates
------------

If your registry uses SSL with a self-issued certificate, you'll need to
supply ``dxf`` with a set of trusted certificate authorities.

Set the ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE`` environment variable to the path of a PEM
file containing the trusted certificate authority certificates.

Both the module and command-line tool support ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE``.

Authentication tokens
---------------------

``dxf`` automatically obtains Docker registry authentication tokens
using your ``DXF_USERNAME`` and ``DXF_PASSWORD``, or
``DXF_AUTHORIZATION``, environment variables as necessary.

However, if you wish to override this then you can use the following
command:

-  ``dxf auth <repo> <action>...``

       Authenticate to the registry using ``DXF_USERNAME`` and
       ``DXF_PASSWORD``, or ``DXF_AUTHORIZATION``, and print the
       resulting token.

       ``action`` can be ``pull``, ``push`` or ``*``.

If you assign the token to the ``DXF_TOKEN`` environment variable, for
example:

``DXF_TOKEN=$(dxf auth fred/datalogger pull)``

then subsequent ``dxf`` commands will use the token without needing
``DXF_USERNAME`` and ``DXF_PASSWORD``, or ``DXF_AUTHORIZATION``, to be
set.

Note however that the token expires after a few minutes, after which
``dxf`` will exit with ``EACCES``.

Docker Cloud authentication
---------------------------

You can use the
```dockercloud`` <https://github.com/docker/python-dockercloud>`__
library to read authentication information from your Docker
configuration file and pass it to ``dxf``:

.. code:: python

    auth = 'Basic ' + dockercloud.api.auth.load_from_file()
    dxf_obj = dxf.DXF('index.docker.io', repo='myorganization/myimage')
    dxf_obj.authenticate(authorization=auth, actions=['pull'])
    dxf_obj.list_aliases()
