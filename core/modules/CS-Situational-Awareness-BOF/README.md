# Situational Awareness BOF
This repo intends to serve two purposes.  First it provides a nice set of basic situational awareness commands implemented in a Beacon Object File (BOF).  This allows you to perform some checks on a host before you begin executing commands that may be more invasive.

Its larger goal is providing a code example and workflow for others to begin making more BOFs. It is a companion document of the blog post made here: https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/a-developers-introduction-to-beacon-object-files/

## Making a new BOF
If you want to use the same workflow as this repository, your basic steps are as follows:
1. Make a folder that covers the target topic, for example in this repo we are using SA
2. Copy the base_template into topic/commandname
3. Modify the Makefile to have your commandname on the first line. This should be the same as the folder name
4. If doing something other then SA, make sure to modify lines 14 and 15 of the makefile as well so its moved to the correct location
5. Make a .cna file in the base of your topic folder and add the commands that you reference. If you followed this format you can take the helper function readbof from SA.cna

Realistically, this could be compressed into a helper script, but those steps were not taken for this effort.

Note the reason for including reg_query when CS has a built in reg query(v) command is because this one can target remote computers and has the ability to recursively enumerate a whole key.

#### Credits
The functional code for most of these commands was taken from the reactos project or code examples hosted on MSDN.
The driversigs codebase comes from https://gist.github.com/jthuraisamy/4c4c751df09f83d3620013f5d370d3b9

Thanks all of the contributors listed under contributors. Each of you have contributed something meaningful to this repository and dealt with me and my review processes. I appreciate each and every one of you for teaching me and helping make this BOF repository the best it can be!

##### Compiler used
BOF's are built against [freefirex2/ts_bof_builder:latest](https://hub.docker.com/r/freefirex2/ts_bof_builder)

## System Support
These BOF's are written with support for Windows Vista+ in mind. A new branch called [winxp_2003](https://github.com/trustedsec/CS-Situational-Awareness-BOF/tree/winxp_2003) has been created if you need to use the main set of BOF's on those older systems. This branch will remain in a less supported state. It will be functional, but not updated with every new push / feature that we may add.

## Want to Learn More?
If you've found these beacon object files helpful and want to write some of your own bofs following a similar style we invite you to check out our [Beacon Object File (BOF) Development](https://learn.trustedsec.com/courses/cd84409a-36af-4507-be2c-ca7ad1e9fd2d) course.  
The course gives a breif overview of the history of beacon object files and then dives into a variety of challenge problems that aim to teach you how to leverage a variety of windows technologies when developing your own beacon object files.
