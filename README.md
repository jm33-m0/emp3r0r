## Motivation

Initially, emp3r0r was developed as one of my weaponizing experiments. It was a learning process for me trying to implement common Linux adversary techniques and some of my original ideas.

**So, what makes emp3r0r different?** First of all, it is the first C2 framework that targets Linux platform including the capability of using any other tools through it. Take a look at the [features](#features) for more valid reasons to use it.

In fact, emp3r0r has complete [python3.9 support](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/wiki/Write-modules-for-emp3r0r#python), which is less than 7MB with necessary third party packages such as `Requests` or `MySQL`.
