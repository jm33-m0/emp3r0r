# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Always use the latest version

## AI Usage

- Feel free to use AI for automation. I also use it.
- When communicating the vulnerabilities to me, please make sure you understand what you are reporting and write the messages on your own.
- You still need to test your vulnerability. Don't paste an AI-generated code auditing report without any verification.

## Threat Model

- Treat C2 server and operators as trusted. Currently only single operator mode is implemented.
- All operators have to be authenticated via WireGuard and mTLS. Communication is therefore protected.
- Treat agents as hostile. TOFU model assumes the first run of an agent is trusted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Send them via encrypted email with instructions [here](https://jm33.me/pages/gpg.html)
- Open a security advisory [here](https://github.com/jm33-m0/emp3r0r/security/advisories/new)
